# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? When you're trying to compare something, so something that can be defined as true or false, i.e. is the integer 6 less than the integer 8?
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? I actually don't know that I would do anything differently. I went through the definitions of everything beforehand and wrote down notes to help it stick in my mind a little better, which really helped me get through the work. 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? I think when I did hit a hiccup, being able to go back to my notes that I took and seeing the small detail that I missed and being like "Ah!" because then I knew exactly what I was needing to input to get the desired result.
